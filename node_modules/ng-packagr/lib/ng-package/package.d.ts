/**
 * A package being built. Quoting Angular Package Format, a package is:
 *
 * > the smallest set of files that are published to NPM and installed together, for example
 * > `@angular/core`. (..) The package is installed with `npm install @angular/core`.
 *
 * #### Package and Entry Points
 *
 * A package is composed of several (one or more) entry points.
 * A package must contain at least the primary entry point but can have many secondary entry
 * points.
 * The module ID of the primary entry point, e.g. `@angular/core`, matches the package name, e.g.
 * the package name is given to the command `npm install @angular/core`.
 * The source code files within a package are referenced by the entry points.
 *
 * #### Representation in the domain
 *
 * A _Package_ is reflected by `NgPackage`.
 * An _Entry Point_ is reflected by `NgEntryPoint`.
 * One `NgPackage` relates to one (or many) `NgEntryPoint`,
 * one `NgEntryPoint` relates to one `NgPackage`.
 *
 * #### Watch Out
 *
 * The user's configuration `ngPackage` suggests that it reflects a `NgPackage`.
 * However, the values given in the `lib` property reflect an `NgEntryPoint`.
 * In case the package contains only one entry point, `ngPackage.lib` reflects the primary entry
 * point.
