/**
 * An entry point - quoting Angular Package Format - is:
 *
 * > a module intended to be imported by the user. It is referenced by a unique module ID and
 * > exports the public API referenced by that module ID. An example is `@angular/core` or
 * > `@angular/core/testing`. Both entry points exist in the `@angular/core` package, but they
 * > export different symbols. A package can have many entry points.
 *
 * #### Public API, source file tree and build output
 *
 * An entry point serves as the root of a source tree.
 * The entry point's public API references one TypeScript source file (`*.ts`).
 * That source file, e.g. `public_api.ts`, references other source files who in turn may reference
 * other source files, thus creating a tree of source code files.
 * The source files may be TypeScript (`*.ts`), Templates (`.html`) or Stylesheets
 * (`.css`, `.scss`, ..), or other formats.
 *
 * The compilation process for an entry point is a series of transformations applied to the source
 * files, e.g. TypeScript compilation, Inlining of Stylesheets and Templates, and so on.
 * As a result of the compilation process, an entry point is transpiled to a set of artefacts
 * (the build output) which include a FESM'15 Bundle, a FESM'5 Bundle, AoT metadata, TypeScript
 * type definitions, and so on.
 *
 * #### Representation in the domain
 *
 * The set of artefacts is reflected by `NgArtefacts`;
 * one `NgEntryPoint` relates to one `NgArtefacts`.
 * The parent package of an entry point is reflected by `NgPackage`.
